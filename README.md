BankProduct Manager
==========================
This is a Java project developed for the second semester in Athens University of Economics and Business [AUEB](https://www.aueb.gr/), aiming to create a bank manager that calculates commissions for sellers of loans and credit cards.

Info
--------------------
The project simulates a bank manager that can handle loans and credit card accounts, as well as their transactions, and calculate the commission that sellers earn for each successful sale. The program uses object-oriented programming techniques to model the bank accounts, transactions, and sellers, and it implements a GUI interface for user interaction.

Features
----------------
- Loan and credit card accounts creation and management
- Transactions recording and reporting for each account
- Commission calculation for sellers based on the sales they have made
- User-friendly GUI for interacting with the system
- Automated tests to ensure the correctness of the program

Usage
---------
To run the program, you need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. Once you have installed the JDK, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine
1. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans)
1. Run the Main.java class to start the program
1. Follow the instructions on the GUI to interact with the system and perform transactions
